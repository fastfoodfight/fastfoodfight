## üçî fish / kel / mustard
heyyy hey hey heyyyy i'm **fish** but you can call me by the name of **whatever skin i'm in** too!
- you'll usually see me running around with friends or in the dnb area, though i don't play super often!
- **i don't care if you copy my skins** or whatever people are so pressed about but most of them are my own headcanons sooo
- i'm mostly seen as zetrus, banzack, bamburg, and sometimes bamberly, these are kins but **i don't mind doubles at all**! i love seeing other people's skins, please interact!!
- **i love any kind of interactions** (boop, kiss, etc)!!!!
- **i have crazyyy social anxiety** so i'm really sorry if conversations are stiff or i don't respond when i should! i'm listening :)
