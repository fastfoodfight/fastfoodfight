heyyy hey hey heyyyy i'm **fish** but you can call me by the name of **whatever skin i'm in** too!
- you'll usually see me running around with friends or in the dnb area, though i don't play super often!
- **i don't care if you copy my skins** or whatever people are so pressed about but most of them are my own headcanons sooo
- i'm mostly seen as zetrus, banzack, bamburg, dambu, and sometimes bamberly, these are kins but **i don't mind doubles at all**! i love seeing other people's skins, please interact!!
- **i love any kind of interactions** (boop, kiss, etc)!!!!
- **i have crazyyy social anxiety** so i won't int first usually, and i'm really sorry if conversations are stiff or i don't respond when i should! promise i'm listening :)
- i am usually online/matching with the [husband](https://github.com/transgenderwedsen) and in vc, however it is totally ok to interact with me even if we seem busy!
- comfort characters include **pretty much everyone in popcorn edition** but especially **bampal**, i love most other dnb characters too especially if they're a pair/part of a group with my main skins (bombu, stylish gods, bambistep, etc)!! **if your skin is any of these pleaaaaaaase interact** i wanna seeee!!!!!
