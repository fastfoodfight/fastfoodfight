heyyy hey hey heyyyy i'm **fish** but you can call me by the name of **whatever skin i'm in** too!
- i'm always in the dave and bambi area or sometimes running around with friends!
- **i don't care if you take inspo from me** but try not to carbon copy lol. i won't say anything if you do though i'm not clinically insane
- **i love any kind of interactions** (boop, kiss, etc)!!!! it's also always ok to interact even if i seem busy!
- **my anxiety is literally crazzyyyy** and i'm kinda socially inept so i won't int first usually, and i'm really sorry if conversations are stiff or i don't respond when i should.. promise i'm listening! i find it much easier when i'm with my [husband](https://github.com/transgenderwedsen) :)

thanks for reading! if you're interested in being friends then my socials are to the left <-- ^_^ (on pc at least lul)
