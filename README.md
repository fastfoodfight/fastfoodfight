heyyy hey hey heyyyy i'm **fish** but you can call me by the name of **whatever skin i'm in** too!
- i'm always in the dave and bambi area or sometimes running around with friends! my usual skins are zetrus, bamburg, banzack, dambu, and bamberly! usually i'm on the safe server but occasionally i will join the 18+ server with my friends
- i am a huge fan of popcorn edition and i love seeing other people's skins from it ^_^ please interact! i also like other dave and bambi mods too (gapple, technological gastronomy, getting into stadium edition...) i'm always open to hearing about other ones! infodump to me :p
- **i don't care if you take inspo from me** but try not to carbon copy lol. i won't say anything if you do though i'm not clinically insane
- **i love any kind of interactions** (boop, kiss, etc)!!!! it's also always ok to interact even if i seem busy!
- **my anxiety is literally crazzyyyy** and i'm kinda socially inept so i won't int first usually, and i'm really sorry if conversations are stiff or i don't respond when i should.. promise i'm listening! i find it much easier when i'm with my [husband](https://github.com/transgenderwedsen) :)
- if i go silent on you and we're just sitting there feel free to leave if you want (i almost never leave first), i don't take offense or anything lol

thanks for reading! if you're interested in being friends then my socials are to the left <-- ^_^ (on pc at least lul)
